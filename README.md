# Shoply - An E-commerce Practice Project

**Disclaimer:** This project is primarily for practice and demonstration purposes. It currently utilizes only local
arrays for data storage and has known bugs. The long-term plan for this project includes building a backend using Spring
Boot in Java to enhance functionality and eliminate existing issues.

## Overview

Shoply is a practice e-commerce website built with Angular. It is intended to serve as a learning tool and a starting
point for those looking to develop their Angular skills. This project is not a final, production-ready e-commerce
platform but rather a foundation upon which you can build your e-commerce application.
